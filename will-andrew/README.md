# Code 301 Lab 01-mobile-first

**Andrew Bloom and Joe Waine**
**Version 1.0.0**

## Overview
Our goal with this project was to create a responsive mobile-first website using html and CSS with no javascript.

## Getting Started
To build this app on your own machine, clone this repo and launch the html page in your browser.

## Architecture
We are using a SMACSS organization of our CSS. We are using some light CSS animations to display and hide the menu, and we are using link tags to call the CSS in.

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Joe Waine, based off of source code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. We used the clearfix CSS convention from CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/ and the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css.
