# Code 301 Lab 02 jQuery and the DOM

**Andrew Bloom and Will Reid**
**Version 1.0.1**

## Overview
Our goal with this project was to build on a mobile-first site, using jQuery to dynamically render blog posts sorted by most recent publication date.

## Getting Started
To build this app on your own machine, clone this repo and launch the html page in your browser.

## Architecture
We are using a SMACSS organization of our CSS. We are using some light CSS animations to display and hide the menu, and we are using link tags to call the CSS in.

## Change Log
10-23-2017 1:00pm adding jQuery logic to render articles on the blog page.  Please see the GitHub commit log for more details.

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Will Reid, based off of source code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. We used the clearfix CSS convention from CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/, the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css and the jQuery v3.2.1 library.  Joe Waine helped build the CSS on the previous day's assignment.
